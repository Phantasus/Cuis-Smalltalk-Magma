# 5. May 2021 (jpb)

I tried to file out all the related classes for magma, but I found
out that I find it hard, without knowing enough Squeak to automate
the extension modifications which were done by Magma on the different
classes in the system.

For my taste Magma is way too much modularized, too many packages
don't help in understanding, which will be one of the first things
I'll fix.

As I currently failed to include all the extension classes I filed
the ones out by hand, which is a tedious process. Only for the
`SOLHashtables` and `WriteBarrier` packages I filedout the extensions,
as these are rather smallish.

Anyway I commit the current state, so that it does not get lost.
